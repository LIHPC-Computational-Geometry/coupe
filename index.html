Coupe is a mesh partitioning platform. It provides solutions to solve different
variants of the mesh partitioning problem, mainly in the context of
load-balancing parallel mesh-based applications. From partitioning weights
ensuring balance to topological partitioning that minimizes communication
metrics through geometric methods, Coupe offers a large panel of algorithms to
fit user-specific problems. Coupe exploits shared memory parallelism, is written
in Rust, and consists of a library and command line tools. Experimenting with
different algorithms and parameters is easy.
