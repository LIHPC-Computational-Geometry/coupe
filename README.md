# [coupe]

A modular, multi-threaded partitioning library.

Coupe implements a variety of algorithms that can be used to partition meshes,
graphs and numbers.  See [the API docs][coupe] for a list.  These algorithms can
be composed together to build relevant partitions of your data.

## Usage

### From the command-line

A list of tools is provided to work with coupe from the command-line, you may
find them, along with their documentation in the `tools/` directory.

### From Rust

See the API documentation on [docs.rs][coupe], and the `examples/` directory for
example usages of the library.

### From other languages

Coupe offers a C interface which can be found in the `ffi/` directory.

Bindings for other languages have not been made yet.  If you end up developing
such bindings, please send us a note so they can be shown here!
