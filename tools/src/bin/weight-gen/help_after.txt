DISTRIBUTION
    The option "-d, --distribution" defines how input weights are laid out.  It
    can be specified multiple times, one for each criterion.  Its value must
    follow the following syntax:

        distribution  :=  name *( "," param)
        param         :=  value / axis
        name          :=  STRING
        value         :=  FLOAT
        axis          :=  "x" / "y" / "z" / "0" / "1" / "2"

    For example, the following will lay out weights in ascending order on the
    horizontal (X, abscissa) axis, from 0 to 100:

        --distribution linear,x,0,100

    And the following example shows how to set the weights to the same value:

        --distribution constant,4.2

SUPPORTED DISTRIBUTIONS
    The following distributions are supported:

    constant,VALUE
        Set all weights to be equal to the given VALUE.

    linear,AXIS,FROM,TO
        Weights follow a linear slope on the given axis, where the points at the
        lowest coordinate on that axis are assigned the value FROM, and the one
        at the highest coordinate are assigned the value TO.
