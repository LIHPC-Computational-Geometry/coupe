ALGORITHMS

    The option "-a, --algorithm" defines the algorithm used to partition the
    input mesh.  It can be specified multiple times to chain algorithms.

    If a partition improving algorithm is in the begining of the chain, it will
    be fed a default partition where all weights are in the same part.

    When an algorithm is avaiable on multiple partitioners, add ":partitioner"
    to choose between implementations (e.g. rcb:zoltan).

    Miscellaneous partitioning algorithms:

        random,PART_COUNT,[SEED]
            Creates a random partition (coupe)

    Number partitioning algorithms:
    These algorithms create partitions by only taking weights into account.

        greedy,PART_COUNT
            Greedy number partitioning algorithm (coupe)

        kk,PART_COUNT
            Karmarkar-Karp, Least Difference Method (coupe)

        ckk,TOLERANCE
            Complete Karmarkar-Karp (coupe)

    Number partition improving algorithms:
    These algorithms improve a partition by only taking weights into account.

        vn-best,PART_COUNT
            Steepest descent Vector of Numbers algorithm (coupe)

        vn-first,PART_COUNT
            Descent Vector of Numbers algorithm (coupe)

    Geometric partitioning algorithms:
    These algorithms create partitions by taking weights and coordinates into
    account.

        rcb,PART_COUNT
            Recursive Coordinate Biscection (coupe)

        hilbert,PART_COUNT,[ORDER]
            Hilbert Curve (coupe)
