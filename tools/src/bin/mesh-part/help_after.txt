ALGORITHMS

    The option "-a, --algorithm" defines the algorithm used to partition the
    input mesh.  It can be specified multiple times to chain algorithms.

    If a partition improving algorithm is in the begining of the chain, it will
    be fed a default partition where all weights are in the same part.

    When an algorithm is avaiable on multiple partitioners, add ":partitioner"
    to choose between implementations (e.g. rcb:zoltan).

    Miscellaneous partitioning algorithms:

        random       Creates a random partition (coupe)

    Number partitioning algorithms:
    These algorithms create partitions by only taking weights into account.

        greedy       Greedy number partitioning algorithm (coupe)
        kk           Karmarkar-Karp, Least Difference Method (coupe)
        ckk          Complete Karmarkar-Karp (coupe)

    Number partition improving algorithms:
    These algorithms improve a partition by only taking weights into account.

        vn-first     VN First (coupe)
        vn-best      VN Best (coupe)
        vn-worst     VN Worst (coupe)

    Geometric partitioning algorithms:
    These algorithms create partitions by taking weights and coordinates into
    account.

        rcb          Recursive Coordinate Biscection (coupe)
        hilbert      Hilbert Curve (coupe)
