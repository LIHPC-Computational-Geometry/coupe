DISTRIBUTION

    The option "-d, --distribution" defines how input weights are generated.  It
    can be specified multiple times, one for each criterion.  Its value must
    follow the following syntax:

        distribution        :=  distribution-name *( "," distribution-param )
        distribution-name   :=  one of the distributions in the following list
        distribution-param  :=  any floating-point number (eg. "42.01")

    For example, the following will generate a one-criterion number set
    distributed uniformily between 0 and 100:

        --distribution uniform,0,100

    And the following example shows how to generate a two-criteria vector-of-
    number set, which first criterion follows a normal distribution and the
    second a beta distribution:

        --distribution normal,100,2 --distribution beta,0.2,0.2


SUPPORTED DISTRIBUTIONS

    uniform LOWER_BOUND UPPER_BOUND
        The uniform distribution. Takes two parameters: one for each bound.

    normal MEAN STD_DEV
        The normal/gaussian distribution. Takes two parameters: the first is
        for the mean/average and the other for the standard deviation.

    exp LAMBDA
        The exponential distribution, whose density is
        LAMBDA * exp(-LAMBDA * x)

    pareto SCALE SHAPE
        The pareto distribution, whose density is
        SHAPE * SCALE^SHAPE / x^(SHAPE + 1)

    beta ALPHA BETA [SCALE]
        The beta distribution.  Both first parameters must be strictly greater
        than zero.  The third "SCALE" parameter may be used to change the upper
        bound, so that this distribution may be used with integers.  Defaults to
        1.
